		<b><p class="title">Different Words</p></b>
		<p class="difW"><b>Islam</b> = <b>ISIS</b>?</p>
		<br />
		<p class="p">First of all... I wanna say <b>'Hi'</b> like a Human.</p>
		<p class="p">Everyone knows that there are bad and good people, right?Many bad Muslims and Many Good Muslims! many bad Christians and many good Christians! and many good Atheists and many bad...! So just respect us and we will respect!</p>
		<p class="p">So just ask yourself... Why there are many videos and websites and pages in facebook and many more social media things about Prophet Muhammad? (Saying bad things?)</p>
		<p class="p">You may answer that he was a killer and he was bad! and he was a false prophet, right?</br>So if he was a false prophet why some of the Christians are attacking us from the socials that I talked about?! Attack prophet Muhammad when you die (If you dare!) not us! Not our Book! not our religion! ISIS is claimed by PEOPLE to be a Islam religion! Every religion in this world is a peace, every God! God means peace (In any religion (Like: Allah, Jesus, Budha, Yahweh... and many more))</br>Do you have a Muslim friend? If Yes... then how is he/she? Good right? She/He is a terrorist? Nope... Some of people says that when someone said: Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) Allahu Akbar is only a word that everyone can say it! A Real Muslim or any religion (a real christian or a real jew) must respect and don't hate anyone just because of his religion! Quran nowadays or Allah or Muhammad is the worst word by some of the Christinas! I claim that book (Quran) is the Misunderstood Book ever! I have some things to tell the christians through this website: Does Jesus taught you to fight Muslims (or anyone) through Socials or saying bad things to the Book or the God or the person that he founded the religion (Prophet Muhammad)?</br>We as a Muslims! We still respect Jesus and we will if our Blood be in the ground!! We love <b>Jesus (pbuh)</b> ♥️ more than those Christians that they don't understand us and don't respect our Book or us (We don't force anyone to be a Muslim and sorry we (Our God) don't need someone who can't respect others!)</br>Need to understand who was Muhammad? He married 9 years old? he was a prophet? He killed someone? He forced people to say There is not God but God, and Muhammad is his Messenger?</br>Study! The frst verse in Quran was: Read!</br>Why you won't read? What will you do after your death if these things (Quran, Prophet Muhammad) was from the true God? Nothing? You may ask us what will YOU Muslims do?! We muslims don't afraid for EXAMPLE if Jesus is God, you know why? because we never attacked any religion (A real Muslim)! any God in that sky needs from his Humans respect and love! and Worship but 100% respect and love one! You have to (First Verse Quran: READ) before you talk! We are trying to post some historical stuff about Aisha (Ra) and Quran Violent verses... We Muslims claim that ISIS isn't equal to Islam! Why you can't remmeber before ISIS came, did anyone killed because of unbelieving?! But they are equal to "The Wolves of Hell", if your trying to destroy Islam, don't! Because you won't gain anything! But you can attack and destroy the governments of the Islamic Countries <b style="color: red;">(BECAUSE THEY AREN'T MUSLIMS!!!!)</b>, so be with us (We don't force anyone to be a Muslim and we are just trying to show World that Muhammad isn't equal to ISIS! You don't believe in Quran we don't care just be in your religion we don't force you...) And sorry for any bad word that used in this webpage, and we love anyone who seen this ☺️</p>
